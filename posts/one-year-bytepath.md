It's been 1 year since I released [BYTEPATH](https://store.steampowered.com/app/760330/BYTEPATH/) and since Steam now allows it I've decided to share its sales data so that other indiedevs have more data points to work with in their own efforts. I've already written a more [in depth article](https://github.com/adnzzzzZ/blog/issues/35) on the game's release so this one will be very short and straight to the point.

## Data

This is what the graph for sales looks like:

</p>

Each subsequent small bump in the graph after release either corresponds to a sale (all sales were for 50% off) or a random event, like the game getting mentioned in the comments of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsmEuHa1eL8):

The total number of units sold was **5,582** and the gross revenue was **$8,833**. This is what the breakdown by country and OS looks like (the game was released on Windows and Linux):

This is what wishlist activity looks like:

</p>

The number of current outstanding wishes is **4,565** and the lifetime conversation rate was **28.1%**. I did nearly no wishlist building before the game was released so most of this activity came after release, and the graph of wishlist activity follows the sales graph pretty closely.

This is what play time looks like:

This is what views, click through rate and store page visits look like:

</p>

The leftmost number corresponds to the number of views the game's capsule had on the store. The rightmost number corresponds to the number of views on the game's store page. The middle number corresponds to the percentage of capsule views that turn into store page visits.

Out of all store page views, 80% were generated by Steam and 20% came from external sites. Those 20% can probably mostly be attributed to my own marketing efforts but I didn't add proper analytics to my game's page so I can't know for sure. Either way, my own marketing efforts were mostly [writing the tutorial for the game](https://github.com/adnzzzzZ/blog/issues/30), which was well received and generated as much attention on the game as a tutorial could, and posts that I made when the game was released on reddit, like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/7zu9vz/i_made_a_small_game_inspired_by_poes_passive/). 

Out of the 80% that Steam generated, 50% was generated via other product pages, around 7% through tag pages and around 4% through each home page and search results.
